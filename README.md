ENVIRONMENT DATA COLLECTION AND PREDICTION IOT SYSTEM Jan 2018 to Current
Using NodeMCU (based on ESP8266, integrated with GPIO, PWM, IIC, WIFI, 1-Wire, and ADC)
implemented a system programmed using "C" that would transfer measured data from the
environment to the cloud then proceed to process the data using Machine learning algorithms in
order to form predictions regarding the environment's future state.
•Incorporated Humidity, temperature, Gas, an Optical sensor to collect data regarding the
system's environment
•Used MATLAB to organize and analyze data,
•Processed the data using a ML algorithm implemented on MATLAB and successfully made
predictions regarding the environment's status at a given time in the future.
